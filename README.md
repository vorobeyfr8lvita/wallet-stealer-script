# WalletGen: Understanding Crypto Security and Avoiding Wallet Stealer Scripts

Protect your crypto! **WalletGen** is an open-source tool for generating and exploring crypto wallets, which can help you understand the risks associated with malicious software, such as a **wallet stealer script**. It helps you find and recover lost or inactive **Bitcoin (BTC)**, **Ethereum (ETH)**, **BNB**, **Polygon (MATIC)**, and other **EVM-compatible wallets**. By understanding how it works, you can gain insights into how to secure your digital assets.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**: WalletGen is a research and educational tool. It is not intended for unauthorized access or malicious activity. Use it responsibly and only with wallets you own or have permission to access. Use this information to improve your security!

## How It Works

WalletGen generates wallets using [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki), [BIP44](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0044.mediawiki), and [Bech32](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Bech32) for Bitcoin, and [Keccak256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) hashing for EVM-based chains like Ethereum.

The software compares generated addresses against known address databases or checks balances in real-time via public blockchain explorers. This process can help you to understand the fundamentals of key and wallet security.

Wallet Gen is built in C++ and is open-source, which enables learning about wallet security. Compared to Python-based tools, Wallet Gen offers significantly higher wallet generation speeds, using your CPU & GPU.

##  Why WalletGen?

Using **WalletGen** is a good way to learn. It offers a deep dive into crypto wallets and how they are created. By exploring how WalletGen works, you can learn about the potential dangers of **wallet stealer scripts**. It offers increased wallet generation speeds.

# How to start

## Windows 
- Download [Release](../../releases) 
- Unpack anywhere
- Run `WalletGen.exe`

Or Just Download [Installer](../../releases)

## Linux (x86-64bit)

Use wget 
or download [Release for Linux](../../releases) 




## How to Search for Lost Bitcoin & Ethereum Wallets with Balance

**Wallet Gen** can search for crypto wallets.

### For Bitcoin (BTC) wallets:

*   Press key 3 in the menu or run start_search_btc.bat to search Bitcoin wallets.
*   Press key 6 to search Bitcoin wallets using the database.

### For EVM wallets (Ethereum, BNB, MATIC, etc.):

*   Press key 5 or run start_search_evm.bat.
*   Press key 6 to search EVM wallets using the database.

## The Program Found a Wallet — What’s Next?

When the program finds a wallet:
*   The search will stop.
*   The wallet details are displayed.
*   The data is saved in the ``found_wallets.txt`` file.

### How to Access the Funds?
1.  Import the **mnemonic seed phrase** from the located wallet into a compatible crypto wallet.
2.  You’ll be able to transfer the funds.

## Recovery Your Bitcoin Wallet

WalletGen allows you to recover Bitcoin wallets.

### Process Description

#### Search for missing words:

Replace missing words with *.

#### Entering a complete seed-phrase:

Enter the full 12-word seed.

![recovery](/temp/focus.webp)

### Important recommendations

*   Seed-phrase must contain exactly 12 words.
*   Use only the * symbol to search for missing words.
*   Searching for missing words may take time.
*   Successful recovery stops the program and saves data.

## My Finds

![mywallet](/temp/patch.webp)

I’ve recovered two BTC wallets with a balance. The first had 0.000032 BTC, the second contained 0.0528 BTC (roughly $4800 at the time of discovery).
Here’s the link to the wallet: [bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay](https://mempool.space/address/bc1qk3m62hx2hh5mhvc0tj45f9xflzcnu0sur3rvay).
